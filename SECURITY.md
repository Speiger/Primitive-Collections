# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Due to how the releases work, only the latest versions will be supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately.     
**Please refrain from posting in public issues.**     
This gives me time to process issues that are being found, and reduces the possiblity of abuse while patches are being created.   
Please disclose it [here](https://github.com/Speiger/Primitive-Collections/security/advisories/new).

Please consider that this project is developed by a single person.    
So please provide a reasonable timeframe when reporting.
